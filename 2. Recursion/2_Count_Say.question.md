Here's a challenging, analytical coding question that requires recursion to solve:

### **Problem: The Count and Say Sequence**

The **"Count and Say"** sequence is a series of strings where the next term is generated by describing the previous term's digit counts.

#### Rules:

1. The sequence starts with `"1"`.
2. To generate the next term, count and say the digits of the current term:
   - Read off the digits of the current term, grouping the same digits together.
   - Count the number of digits in each group and write it next to the digit.

#### Examples:

- **n = 1**: `"1"` (starting term)
- **n = 2**: `"11"` (one `1` -> `"11"`)
- **n = 3**: `"21"` (two `1s` -> `"21"`)
- **n = 4**: `"1211"` (one `2`, then one `1` -> `"1211"`)
- **n = 5**: `"111221"` (one `1`, one `2`, two `1s` -> `"111221"`)

#### Your Task:

Write a **recursive function** to compute the `n`th term of the "Count and Say" sequence.

### **Function Signature**

```python
def count_and_say(n: int) -> str:
    # Your code here
```

### **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq n \leq 30 \) (the sequence grows rapidly in size)

---

### **Hint**

1. Break the problem into smaller subproblems. Use recursion to get the previous term and process it to form the current term.
2. Use a helper function to "describe" the digits of a string.
