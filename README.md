# JS-DSA-Algorithms

Welcome to the **JS-DSA-Algorithms** repository! This project is dedicated to implementing core data structures and algorithms in JavaScript, with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and interview readiness. Efficient and well-documented JavaScript implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, tailored for learning and interview preparation.

## Features

- Comprehensive implementations of essential data structures (e.g., arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Key algorithm categories covered: sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph traversal
- Well-documented code to aid understanding and improve readability
- Ideal for preparing for coding interviews at top tech companies

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/genGit963/JS-DSA-Algorithms.git
   ```
2. **Explore and run examples**:
   Review individual data structure or algorithm folders for specific implementations.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add or improve an implementation, please open a pull request.
